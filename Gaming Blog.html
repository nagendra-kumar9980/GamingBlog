                    PUBG Mobile developer Krafton has invested $22.4 million (around Rs 164 crore) in Indian esports and
                    gaming firm Nodwin Gaming. The South Korean game developer and publisher is said to invest in Nodwin
                    Gaming to “maintain some presence in what was once its key overseas market”, according to a
                    TechCrunch report.

                        I first met Courtney in my first year of middle school in my English room. She was so warm and
                        kind that I felt honored to speak to such a nice angel. Courtney became my first true friend
                        that I could ever count on. She was always there in a heartbeat when I needed her wise words of
                        wisdom.
